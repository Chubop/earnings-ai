Excellent, Matt. And when you think about why we acquired WildHealth is that like ourselves, we know we have this precision data set, and we looked at them and said, well, you've got the precision data set on humans and a way to collect that data and the way to correlate it. And so obviously, we're excited about -- what you just saw was the LivePerson platform with our large language models on it, combined with the Clarity platform. When you saw like page numbers, that's the Clarity platform giving you the information that comes off the patients' data. So it's exciting. I think in itself, it's a multibillion-dollar business one day because of the impact it's going to have in the health care industry.
I want to sort of put a period on the end of this hour and talk about something. A year ago, I announced on our call that we were chosen as the #1 AI company in the world by Fast Company, and interesting enough, OpenAI was #3. And we were rated #1, if you go back and look at the article, is because we gave business outcomes. We are working with the -- we work with the largest brands. And at that time, OpenAI was really a set of APIs that our engineers were using and stuff. Obviously, the impact of OpenAI is world-changing since November. And their success has really kicked off, I'll call, the AI space race. And there's going to be a handful of companies like LivePerson that are going to be the next set of technology leaders. And I've said this many times, I think the current technology companies, whether it's Amazon, Google, and it was hard to understand that they could even be taken down and are impacted. But the next set of companies will most likely be a set of AI companies, and LivePerson and our vision and all we've done with our data, our relationships with our customers, our ability to bring our platforms and this technology in a safe way, in a usable way to the enterprise is what puts us in the pole position right now.
Obviously, that's got to be sitting on top of a solid foundation, and we've been around 28 years. We didn't get here from not having a solid foundation. And yes, we took some twists and turns, but starting in Q2, we will have that foundation, and generating cash flow has always been important for us. It creates a discipline in the company. And we're really excited about our future. And I think as shareholders, and I'm still one of the largest shareholders, I just know that we've been waiting for this day. And when you wait this long and it comes, you don't squander the opportunity.
And I know everyone in the company is excited. Even through all the tough times in the last year, we're all excited. Everyone is working hard. We're going to bring this stuff to the market in a very different way, in a LivePerson way, because we build and innovate. We don't copy. And I just want to thank everyone in the company.
And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator. We can take a few questions before we end this Q4 call. Operator?

Okay, first question comes from Ryan MacDonald at Needham.
Can you help us quantify the sources of the revenue shortfall for fiscal '23 relative to '22? And how much is the lack of WildHealth revenue versus Gainshare versus weakness in the core business?
John Collins
Arjun, yes -- or Ryan, sorry. I think we covered this in my prepared remarks, but I can reiterate, of course, the primary sources here. There's $70 million in total that we consider non-core that will not reoccur in 2023. $50 million of that has 2 primary categories: COVID-19 testing and professional services with a strategic partner in the testing and diagnostic space.
With regard to Gainshare labor and pandemic-driven variable revenue, that's approximately $20 million of that figure. It is not WildHealth revenue that is a large contributor here, setting aside the Q4 disclosure that we've provided.
Robert LoCascio
And the other thing is, although WildHealth's coming off a small base, its core business, like the stuff Matt showed you, will double this year in growth rates. So -- but it's a small base compared to our size, but the -- he's got good trajectory there right now.
Chad Cooper
Next question comes from Siti from Mizuho. How should we think about the sequential ramp in profitability throughout the year? How do you get from positive EBITDA and free cash flow in Q2 to a 16% to 19% annualized exit rate by Q4?
John Collins
Yes. Siti, so the primary driver here relates to the cost-out actions that are underway as we speak in the first quarter. That's a large body of cost that will exit. So that's what will flip us to profitability from the Q1 numbers directly in Q2 in a couple of weeks. That alone will drive substantially the profitability in the ramp throughout the year. In addition, of course, our recurring revenue base is growing as well. And that's a function of the core software bookings that we expect throughout the year and the AI-led growth.
It's interesting to note where we're seeing a lot of action. And at the moment, there's extraordinary demand for AI demos along the lines of what you've seen here. So that's flowing into our views, of course, on bookings going forward. But we're being conservative, hence the low single-digit to mid-single-digit guide on recurring revenue.
Chad Cooper
Thanks, John. Next question is from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. How do you plan to contain the distraction from several moving pieces in the business in order to ensure you can execute on the core?
Robert LoCascio
Yes, we -- I think that's what we try to get across, we're done with the distractions. So starting in Q2, we have a clean P&L. Basically, we have our core business. We've got our health care business and that's what we're going to live and die on. So we're focused on it. We had to do a lot of things over the last year to prepare for this. But starting Q2, we have focused only on those areas.
Chad Cooper
Next question, also from Arjun. How is WildHealth monetized? What is the revenue model and accounting for the business?
John Collins
Yes, I'll start. But then I think since we have Matt on the call, I'll kick it over to him to explain some of the core business drivers. In terms of accounting, it is currently in our hosted revenue line, and there's both recurring and pay-as-you-go revenue. And Matt, I'll turn over to you to talk through the quarter and what drives it.
Matthew Dawson
Sure. Just to be very brief, right now, we do have a recurring revenue model where we have patients coming in, we're seeing patients, taking care of them. And as Rob mentioned, we've doubled our patients in the last 12 months. We expect the core business to double again over the next 12 months. We're seeing good growth, but to be honest, this is more of R&D and we're seeing patients. We are proving that this works, that this is the best health care in the world. We've now gotten the best health care outcomes in the world, and we think that millions of people deserve this and everyone should get it.
So the real opportunity is taking this technology, adding the AI layer in and licensing it to every doctor so this can be everywhere. So that's the future. We're growing fast, but the future really is giving this out to everyone, not just the patients that we can see with our doctors and with care coaches.
Robert LoCascio
And Matt, you may want to also talk about that we know the stickiness of people who use the platform and is much different than someone who goes to a normal or some -- or use an app or something like that. It's highly, highly sticky once they get on the program.
Matthew Dawson
Yes, it's a great point. It turns out, Rob, people like getting great health care. So our NPS is -- when you look at normal health care, NPS is normally around 0. If you've got a positive NPS, you're great. They're never really over 30. And our NPSs are always in kind of the 60s and 70s. So people really enjoy it. We have really low churn because of that. People stay in the program, they get better. They tell their family members. They stick around with us. So we expect that to be similar for a doctor or a hospital who would license the technology as well. It's going to be a really big upgrade, like I mentioned, for quality and efficiency, which are the 2 things that health care universities and centers really want, is quality and efficiency.
