Thanks, Matt. Next question is from Zach Cummins from B. Riley. Does the current guidance include revenue contribution from the consumer business? Can you speak to the decision to sell that business?
Robert LoCascio
John, you're....
John Collins
Yes. So currently, the consumer business is assumed to be approximately flat year-over-year. So whether it's in or outs, you don't have a material impact on revenue growth. There's a small impact on EBITDA, but that is not in our guidance. So the guidance, to be clear, reflects the -- for EBITDA reflects the business without a contribution from Kasamba for the consumer segment. And from a revenue standpoint, it's neutral. And in terms of the decision to sell it, it's a focus on the B2B core. This entails costs and management cycles. And we have a view for what the B2B core could be, especially the AI-led growth that we're pursuing at this moment. And we think it's the best approach just to kind of draw a line and move forward from there, focused on the B2B core and WildHealth.
Robert LoCascio
Yes. And our focus -- we go back to putting the filter. The filter is, can we use AI in that business. It was a great chat business when we bought it for very small individual proprietaries who want to chat online with their customers. But I can't -- we can't automate it the way we can on the stuff we're doing with health care and the stuff we're doing on the enterprise.
So it just doesn't fit where we think the biggest opportunities are right now. We're getting a good return on it, though, so. It's been 13 years, so.
Chad Cooper
Next question from Peter Levine from Evercore. Can you give a little bit more detail on the sale of the consumer business? How do you value it? And who would be the ideal buyer?
John Collins
Yes. Peter, I think we'll have to wait for the PR on the eventual transaction, which, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect later this month. I can say in terms of how it's valued, clearly, a multiple of EBITDA is the way that, that works, and you'll see more details soon.
Chad Cooper
Follow-up question from Peter. What gives you the confidence that you'll see an inflection point in Q2? And what are you factoring in for macro headwinds for fiscal '23?
Robert LoCascio
We took a pretty conservative approach to bookings and retention rates to create the model and then to get to a cost structure that we could guide to. So I think we feel like there's upside from here. It's going to be interesting. On the macro side, obviously, we deal with the enterprise. And the enterprise has slowed down, but they're holding budgets. Like Q4 normally for us is a very big quarter because people, they want to spend the money that they had in their budgets. And this year, they didn't, they kept it. However, what's going on with the strategy and what's going on with all the stuff on AI, it's an open field right now. I said we've done -- it's like 200 demos we've created already. We just had a packed event. Our largest customer is in the U.K. and it was a packed house. We had -- we did an online seminar, 600 people showed up. So there's a lot of action right now because the enterprise wants to use this to automate a bunch of, obviously, business processes that they have. Whether it's customer care, HR, I feel like it's kind of an open season for demand right now.
Chad Cooper
Follow-up question from Zach Cummins. Can you speak to the current sales capacity and plans to reorient the go-to-market motion in the coming year?
John Collins
I'll start. And Rob, maybe you could -- I'll pass to you to say something about pods and how we're thinking about bringing our technology team closer to customers. So just high level, in terms of quota capacity, we will end the first quarter with approximately 115 quota carriers. So a slight increase over the prior quarter.
Robert LoCascio
And then we've taken our -- we have a base business of 100 of our largest customers, which is -- I think it's a very high percentage of our revenue. And now we created this thing called [LP One], which are pods led by product heads led by the guy who -- co-founder of BotCentral. And now they -- we've invited in those 100 customers to come into the pods, and these are engineering and product lines. And I think it's going to change the game. The one thing I've not liked about B2B sales motions and service motions is you have a lot of layers connecting with the customers who are not always product or engineering people. And they're very important as in I think getting new business, opening up new opportunities, but they're also dealing with what we call account management. And I just don't believe in it as much as I do having our customers talk to product heads. And why is that? Because if you're an AI company and someone shows up with you -- I was just on a call with the CIO of one of the largest telcos the other day and we had a pod head, a pod leader come in, and they're talking the language. They're talking about the tech and that CIO is talking very deeply about what they want to do with this technology. It doesn't work to have them bring in people and do another call and do -- the people who are servicing should be engineers and technologists when it comes to AI, and that's what an AI company would look like to a customer. So that's a big change for us.
Chad Cooper
I have a question coming in actually by e-mail by Tom Blakey from KeyBanc. You mentioned 7% to 10% free cash flow margins and 16% to 19% adjusted EBITDA in the core by the end of '23. What about the total business? When will non-core revenue go to zero?
John Collins
Broadly speaking, non-core revenue should be -- will be worked on throughout the year, but the most -- the largest components that still remain will exit the P&L in the second quarter.
Chad Cooper
Question from Ryan MacDonald at Needham. What incremental investments are needed to effectively sell to a new channel for LivePerson, physicians to start to license the WildHealth platform moving forward?
John Collins
[Indiscernible] the exact amounts and allocations of investments. I would note that we have set aside investment that is reflected in our guidance for both WildHealth and, of course, the generative AI integrations that we think will power our growth in the B2B core going forward.
Robert LoCascio
And the WildHealth business does burn a little bit of cash because of its growth rate. So we are funding for growth, not overfunding. Matt's pretty prudent with the money, but we are -- it's a high-growth business and there's an acquisition there that we're doing. We do direct-to-consumer and then also they have a way to bring doctors in. They're also working with other areas like hospitals. They're starting to open that up. The other thing that's exciting is we got Medicare and Medicaid, although Medicare is a tough group to work with sometimes, as we saw in Q4, but we're also looking at private insurances and all that. So that will open up, cost of acquisition goes down. So there's a lot of potential there right now. But there's a lot of people in the world that want to pay out of pocket. There's physicians who get -- who want to be onboarded to the platform to change the game in how they're providing health care to their patients.
Chad Cooper
I think that's it for questions. Rob, do you want to wrap up?
Robert LoCascio
Sure. Just want to thank everyone for being here. I know this is a different type of quarterly call because we're a different type of company. In 28 years of doing this, we've had 3 separate times in our history where an opportunity came, we were well positioned for it, but we had to make a lot of changes to free us to get there.
And I want to bring also -- obviously, Joe and Matt, thank you guys for being on a call. It's like a high wire act on a quarterly call coming in because you mess up, something is going to happen to you, we'll find you guys. But you did a great job, and I appreciate you showing the investments we're making in the core, the investments we're making in health care.
And I think, once again, as shareholders, I think there's very few AI companies that are public, purely AI. You can bet Microsoft. I would bet it. I think it's amazing what they're doing over there. We have a great relationship with them. It's progressing in many interesting ways. But I think there are very few companies, especially of our size, where you can make a bet. And you can bet on that this is a company that has AI technology, they're an AI company, and they're not just bolting it on as some feature to say that they're on the bandwagon.
So with that, I look forward to the next quarter and showing results and obviously growing in a different way than we have over the last couple of years. So thank you, and see you on the next quarter.
